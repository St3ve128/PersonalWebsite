# PersonalWebsite

This site serves as a showcase for myself, talking about my hobbies and interests, as well as my academic profile consisting of my professional skills and aspirations.
The hobbies that I will talk about will include baseball, cars/motorsport, and model aviation. home.html is where you should start, and from there how to use the site 
should be self-explanatory.
