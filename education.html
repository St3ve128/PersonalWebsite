        I graduated from Turpin High School, Cincinnati, Ohio, in May of 2024. It was during my time in high school that I discovered my passion for computer science and math, 
        particularly through Advanced Placement (AP) classes. Schoolwork was always my highest priority which lead to me ending high school with a GPA of 4.3. While I was
        focused primarily on schoolwork, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to play baseball. I played baseball all 4 years while I attended Turpin and enjoyed almost every
        moment of it. While I no longer play baseball, it will always be a big part of my life.

      I am currently in my first year at Northern Kentucky University. My major is computer science and my minor is mathematics. It was really a no-brainer on what I was 
      going to study in college after finding my passion for computer science during mu junior year of high school. I have always been fairly fond of math but during high 
      school I came to love it. I plan to focus on schoolwork but I definitely will do at least 1 internship before I graduate. I love programming and I am particularly
      fond of Java. I currently aspire to become a software developer upon graduation.
