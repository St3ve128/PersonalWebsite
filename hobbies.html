    <h2 class="roboto-bold">Baseball</h2>

      I have loved baseball all of my life. I started playing baseball as soon as I was physically able and started watching baseball as soon as I was able to
      understand what was going on. Living in Cincinnati, my favorite team in Major League Baseball (MLB) has always been the Reds. My love for baseball and 
      the Reds has made Great American Ballpark one of my favorite places to be. While the Reds have not had much success in the recent years, I am looking 
      foward to the upcoming season. The Reds have a lot of young talent and need to find ways to win. However this is easier said than done being a smaller 
      market team in the MLB, being the only major professional sports league without a salary cap. Nevertheless, I am optimistic about this upcoming season
      and will watch as many Reds games as I can.

        Ever since I was very young I have loved cars. Even at very young ages, my brother and I would always be talking about cars and playing racing games
        on our Xbox. Now being older and able to drive, my love for cars has stayed much the same, just only grown in intensity as I am able to experience
        them for myself now. I am also very interested in motorsport, particularly GT racing.

        My grandfather had his pilot's license and owned a Cessna. He also was into the hobby of model aviation. This influenced me and my brother to each buy
        a remote control plane at a very young age. After becoming older and more capable, we know build our own model planes which is a lot more rewarding.
